# [Live Demo](https://dc-food-trucks.herokuapp.com/companies)

# Intro

Created as a General Assembly WDI project. Ruby on Rails application that demonstrates an idea for a food truck tracker. As a patron of the website I can see where all the food trucks in DC are currently located, look up more information on them, and comment on them. As a food truck owner I can make a new company, create multiple trucks, and set the locations of each truck.

# Intro

Created as a General Assembly WDI project. Ruby on Rails application that demonstrates an idea for a food truck tracker. As a patron of the website I can see where all the food trucks in DC are currently located, look up more information on them, and comment on them. As a food truck owner I can make a new company, create multiple trucks, and set the locations of each truck.

I plan on remaking this application and fully developing it to it's full potential after completing the General Assembly WDI program. The app will utilize a front end framework (React) and keep the Ruby on Rails backend. I will keep the option for food truck owners to log in and edit their page as I will include a lot more information like menus, prices, and pictures. Food trucks will have the option to be both manually updated and updated via twitter posts (Geotagged tweets and Twitter scraping). The geocoder functionality will be improved as well.

Truck logic
If company has only one truck:
Option to auto update truck location based on tweet (geolocation/scrub) BOOLEAN
On new tweet
Verify if tweet has a geolocation
Send Geolocation on JSON string to database 
Else if tweet can be address scrubbed
Search address via google maps api 
Send Geolocation on JSON string to database
Option to manually update truck location with google maps
On manual updated send Geolocation JSON string to database (OVERRIDES TWEET GEOLOCATION IF UPDATED VIA TWITTER)

Else (company has multiple trucks)
Trucks must be manually updated with google maps
(FUTURE GOAL: scrub for multiple locations and allow auto updated)
